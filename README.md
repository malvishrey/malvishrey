### Hi there,

I am a graduate student assistant at Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University, pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science. My research interests include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and image retrieval. I have developed a novel architecture for multi-modal fusion for fake news detection, based on class attention tokens and bottleneck fusion tokens using pre-computed ViTMAE image and BERT text embeddings.


Prior to joining ASU, I worked as an AI solutions developer at simplecrm.com, where I developed a smart knowledge base search system based on ElasticSearch and BERT model embeddings, reduced the latency of the historical returns calculator by 5x, and enhanced the OCR accuracy by 15%. I also worked as a machine learning engineer at Playpower Labs, where I explored GPT3 based OpenAI platform for content generation, assisted in creating a readability-based recommendation system for students, and worked on developing a feature-based page searching algorithm. I have multiple certifications and honors in machine learning, convolutional neural networks, and structuring machine learning projects. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to real-world problems.
